<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In my opinion, there is no better way to learn new skills than working on an interesting project using only the tools you are trying to learn. Therefore, to help me learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JS and TS, I decided to make a website that would help visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work (I currently only implemented A*). I wanted to experiment with pathfinding algorithms for a long time and thought it would be the perfect project do so. 

### Built With
-HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and TypeScript.
-I learned the basics of these languages with tutorials found on https://www.w3schools.com/
